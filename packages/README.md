# App packages

Self-contained non-nixpkgs app packages used by the parent `nix-flakes` repository. The nested flake keeps package CI independent from the parent flake's private inputs.

The [trading-agent repository](https://github.com/gytkk/trading-agent) owns its Rust and web package build and exports `nixosModules.default` for its supervisor and web services. Host configurations consume a verified, pinned product revision and supply host settings and runtime credential paths. This catalog does not duplicate the product package or service definitions.

## Build entrypoints

- `nix build ./packages#packages.<system>.ntn`
- `nix build ./packages#packages.<system>.default` (same as first app)
- `nix run ./packages#apps.<system>.ntn`

`gksdud` is exposed only on Darwin. Its signed universal app bundle supports Apple Silicon and Intel Macs running macOS 13 or later. Home Manager installs it through the [gksdud module](../modules/gksdud/README.md). Automatic startup is controlled by the app's own login-item option.

`lspi` packages the upstream MCP-to-LSP bridge for [Codex's Python integration](../modules/codex/README.md#python-코드-탐색). Upstream provides release binaries for both macOS architectures and x86_64 Linux; the catalog omits it on aarch64 Linux. Linux installation patches the ELF interpreter and runtime library paths for Nix.

## Adding new apps

To add a new app package:

1. Create `packages/apps/<app-name>/package.nix`.
2. Use `callPackage` arguments available from nixpkgs (`stdenvNoCC`, `fetchzip`, etc.).
3. Ensure the package path creates a `meta.mainProgram` if the package should be run via `nix run`.
4. Add `packages/apps/<app-name>/update.sh` if the package should support aggregate updates.
5. Add the package to `packages/default.nix` so the nested flake and parent package outputs expose it. The configuration overlay consumes this catalog.

To disable aggregate updates for an app, add its name to the `update.deny` list in `settings.json`.

The package catalog in `default.nix` is the single source of truth for exported apps and aliases. Register each package there once; the parent package outputs, nested flake, and configuration overlay in `lib/pkgs.nix` expose the full catalog. App-specific settings still belong in `modules/<app>/`, and enabling a package in a profile remains a separate choice.

`ntn` is an alias of `notion-cli` in the catalog. Both attributes provide the same derivation and the `ntn` executable. Aliases need no package directory or updater and do not add duplicate rows to the version table.

## Reusing the tarball CLI builder

The catalog supplies `mkTarballCli` to package functions that request it. Use it for a release tarball containing one executable with optional documentation files. [Databricks CLI](apps/databricks-cli/package.nix) shows the basic case; [Notion CLI](apps/notion-cli/package.nix) shows a nested archive directory and additional installed files.

| Argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pname`, `version` | Package identity, kept in the app's `package.nix`. |
| `platforms` | Attribute set keyed by Nix system. Each entry contains `hash` and any fields needed to construct the URL. |
| `url` | Function from the selected platform entry to the archive URL. |
| `meta` | Normal Nix metadata, including the required `mainProgram`. The executable in the archive must have that name. |
| `sourceRoot` | Optional function from the platform entry to the unpacked directory. Defaults to `_: "."`. |
| `extraInstall` | Optional shell commands after installing the executable and before `postInstall`, for example README and license installation. |

The helper selects the host platform, fetches the pinned archive, disables configure/build phases, installs the executable, runs install hooks, and derives `meta.platforms`. URL conventions, hashes, licenses, and archive-specific facts remain in the app file. Packages with multiple archives, binary patching, wrappers, or source builds continue to use their own `callPackage` expressions.

## Updates and CI

- Run `packages/scripts/update-all.sh` from the parent repository to update every enabled package manually.
- `Update App Versions` checks all enabled packages, including `herdr`, `herdr-annotate`, and `herdr-auto-title`, every three hours in one serialized job. After updater patch checks, flake evaluation, and changed-package builds succeed, it synchronizes the README version table and commits the updates directly to `main` without a PR or approval step.
- Any updater, evaluation, or build failure stops the job before publication, so no updates from that run reach `main`. A patch preflight failure is reported before that updater changes package metadata. If `main` advances during validation, the push is rejected and a later run validates updates against the new base.
- The update job uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with job-scoped `contents: write`. CI currently builds `x86_64-linux`; other platforms are not validated by this workflow.
- `herdr` tracks stable releases and builds from Rust and Zig sources with patches for [Claude administrative command detection](../modules/herdr/README.md#agent-detection) and sidebar status separators. On Linux, the static Ghostty library uses the compiler runtime supplied by the Rust toolchain instead of bundling Zig 0.16's runtime, whose invalid unwind relocations fail to link with GNU ld. Package checks cover plugin APIs and process identification. Cargo dependencies come from the source's `Cargo.lock`; Zig dependencies use its vendored Nix manifest. The hash-pinned source is fetched during evaluation so `nix flake check --no-build` can read both files without building a source derivation first. The executable replacement test uses the build's temporary directory so it can run inside the Linux Nix sandbox. Older nixpkgs inputs use the pinned Zig 0.16 build tool in `apps/herdr/zig.nix`. Its updater pins the source hash and checks every declared patch and the Zig requirement before changing the package.
- `herdr-annotate` tracks the plugin's `main` commit and the versions it declares. Its updater records source hashes, release checksums for `herdr-annotate`, and the source and Cargo dependency hashes for the Rust-built `plannotator-tui` in `apps/herdr-annotate/sources.json`, so changes are detected even when the manifest version stays the same. The reviewer uses unpatched upstream sources and default colors.
- `herdr-auto-title` tracks stable GitHub releases and builds from source. Its updater pins the source and vendored Go dependency hashes using Go from the nested flake's locked nixpkgs input.
- Herdr and the Annotate reviewer each declare their patch order in `patches.nix`, shared by the Nix build and updater preflight. Preflight applies the complete sequence to a writable temporary source copy, retaining Nix's default fuzz tolerance and rejecting reversed patches. Annotate checks patches before Cargo hash discovery and metadata changes. Run `bash packages/tests/check-nix-patches.sh` to check this behavior, and `bash packages/tests/update-all.sh` to check updater selection and failure propagation with local fixtures.
- `pi` pins a stable upstream source archive and calls the official flake's `nix/package.nix` with this catalog's nixpkgs. Upstream owns the workspace build, install lock, model catalog pin, platform dependencies, and install checks; this repository does not maintain a separate npm lockfile. A local override replaces the stale `esbuild` smoke test with a TypeScript execution check through the runtime extension loader, `jiti`, while retaining the other upstream install checks. The updater validates the release version and required packaging files before changing the source pin. Run `bash packages/tests/pi-update.sh` for its failure and no-op checks. The source is fetched during evaluation so upstream lockfiles and metadata are readable without import-from-derivation.
- `codex` installs the complete official `codex-package` bundle, including its manifest, helpers, and runtime resources. Its updater tracks bundle hashes for all four platforms. The package's install check validates the manifest, confirms that every archive member is present in the installed output, and checks required executable permissions. Bundled zsh is checked only when present, since upstream removed it in 0.163.0. Run `bash packages/tests/codex-check-package.sh` to check current and legacy bundle validation with local fixtures.
- `App Packages CI` evaluates the nested flake and builds changed packages, including their install checks.
- `cf` packages the official npm bundle with Node.js 24 and a pinned production dependency lockfile. It provides both `cf` and `cloudflare`. The published development dependencies reference unpublished local archives, so packaging removes them before installing the locked runtime dependencies. Linux builds patch the bundled `workerd` and `sharp` binaries. For a manual update, refresh the source version/hash, generate `package-lock.json` from the npm tarball after removing `devDependencies`, and refresh `npmDepsHash` with `prefetch-npm-deps`. See [Cloudflare CLI setup](../README.md#cloudflare-cli) for authentication.
- `notion-cli` tracks the stable version published at `https://ntn.dev/latest.txt`. Its updater downloads all four platform archives, verifies their official SHA-256 checksums, and updates the version and hashes together after every platform succeeds. The `ntn` alias receives the same updates through the direct channel.
- `pantry` packages a `main` build of the Devsisters teamdev.ai CLI, versioned as `main-<12-character commit>` with no releases or tags. It is listed in `update.deny`, so aggregate updates skip it. To bump it manually, run `bash packages/apps/pantry/update.sh`, which pins the build named by the per-platform `latest/<os>-<arch>.json` manifests after confirming all four agree and each binary matches its manifest SHA-256.
- `cf`, `databricks-cli`, `gksdud`, `lspi`, and `pup` are manually updated. They have no `update.sh`, so aggregate updates skip them. Moving a package into this catalog does not enable automatic updates.
- Package outputs follow each platform's catalog. The Linux build job skips apps absent from the Linux catalog, including `gksdud`; it does not validate their macOS runtime behavior.
- Changes under `lib/` rebuild all catalog package directories. A package-local change rebuilds that package. The changed-app detector is checked with `bash packages/tests/detect-changed-apps.sh`.
