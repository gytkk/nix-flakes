## Critical Rules

- First, deeply understand and think about what you want to achieve with your code.
- Always follow existing code patterns and module structure in your working directory.
- Be concise. Commit small, frequent changes for readable diffs.

## Python

- Always use `uv run` instead of `python` or `python3` when executing Python scripts or commands.
- If dependency errors occur, run `uv sync` first to install project dependencies.
- Examples:
  - Use `uv run script.py` instead of `python script.py`
  - Use `uv run -m pytest` instead of `python -m pytest`
  - Use `uv run -m pip install` instead of `pip install`

## Git

- Prefer [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
- Write commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Keep commits atomic: one logical change per commit.
- Do NOT push unless explicitly requested.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools for sensitive data.

## Testing

- Write tests for new features before or alongside implementation.
- Run existing tests before committing (e.g., `uv run -m pytest`, `npm test`).
- Ensure all tests pass before pushing.
- Cover edge cases and error scenarios in tests.

## Code Review

- Focus on: readability, maintainability, security, and performance.
- Suggest improvements constructively with clear explanations.
- Check for edge cases and proper error handling.
- Verify that changes align with existing code patterns.

## Documentation

- Update README.md when adding new features or changing behavior.
- Add docstrings/comments for complex logic only when necessary.
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
- Do NOT create one-off or temporary documentation files.

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully; avoid silent failures.
- Use specific error types when possible.
- Log errors with enough context for debugging.
- Provide meaningful error messages to users.
